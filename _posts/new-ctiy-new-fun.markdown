I'm from New York with a 4 year pitstop in Washington, DC. Over the past 3 months, I have transitioned to San Francisco with my lovely girlfriend Chelsea. Being new to a town there are a ton of new places to explore, places to eat and things to do. Things are a bit different on the west cost, I can already feel it. Just being able to see the mountains connect to the oceans is truly a powerful feeling. 

This blog will serve as a chronicle of my explorations in San Francisco. Over the coming year, I'll be sharing my favorite Restaurants, Bars and Activities from around the city. Hopefully you will have much as fun as I will.  Feel free to give a few recommendations along the way, I would love to hear from you. 



With love and cheers!
